# Deep Learning Homework - LSTM Stock Predictor


## Summary
The exercise uses recurrent neural networks to predict prices for Bitcoin.  Creating two notebooks using LSTM to focus on Closing price versus the Fear and Greed Index.  After review I believe the model using closing prices provided the better results.  I found that running smaller windows operated better and found that the model using Closing yielded lower loss.

## Notes
Due to install issues with TensorFlow, Colab was used to develop notebooks.
